# livestreaming
live streaming app

I used Wowza, Android, Node.js, Wowza SDK for live streaming, Parse, AWS or so on.

Considering point:
 1) how to provide good quality of live video -> FFmpeg from scratch or Wowza Mobile SDK
 2) How to save a large of amount video files and provide a quality playback -> AWS CDN and S3
 3) How to provide a quality push -> AWS SMS Push
 4) How to provide a nice UI -> Android Xml or React Native app and UI opensources
 5) How to make build and production easy -> fabric
 6) How to provide a clean api system -> volley, glide, iron.io , node.js(fast break)
